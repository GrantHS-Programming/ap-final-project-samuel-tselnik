# AP Computer Science A Final Project
Name: Samuel Tselnik

5/21 Work: Got Balkan set up, read lots of documentation for it.

5/23: Reading the terrible documentation trying to figure out how to update JSON files from the UI

5/28: The documentation is so terrible and unreadable that I'm pivoting to a new project: A virtual journal of my percussion activities. It'll have lesson notes, commonly used resources, pdfs of music I'm learning, things like that.

5/30: Reaquainting with html & css

6/3: Collapsible button formatting & PDF linking

6/5: New example, youtube embeds, formatting fixes

6/7: Why are css boxes and margins and paddings and borders so confusing
